# GamesDatabaseForms

## Overview
This program is a game registration system, allowing users to host and sign up for game tournaments.

It was created in about 1 week in my database class at OIT, so the UI and features are not completely finished. 

## Details
### Technology

The program is completely in C# using WinForms and has an SQL database backend which supports user logins as well as information about games and their scheduling.

### Usage

Users can create an account which is linked to their information such as Name, Display Name, Email, Phone Number, etc.

After creating an account, users can create/host game events by specifying a time, place, pricing, and any other necessary information.

Once an event is created, any user may find the event and sign up for it.

## Installation
Open and run with Visual Studio 2022 (or your IDE of choice)

IMPORTANT: The application will not be able to run correctly because it is missing the App.config file for the project. 
This is for privacy reasons since it contains the connection string I used to connect to our school's database, 
so the backend of this project is unfortunatly unavailable to the public.

## Status
This project is functionally finished, but some UI and features are incomplete.
