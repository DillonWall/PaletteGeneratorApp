# PaletteGeneratorApp

## Overview
This program is an unfinished Python application, which would have generated a color palette based around a user-selected color.

Ideally I wanted to use web scraping along with machine learning to generate new color palettes based on the current most popular palettes.

## Details
I did not finish the project, but I did create a UI in Python using the Kivy library.

This UI has a color picker wheel and corresponding color value sliders/textboxes for RGBA, HSV, and Hexadecimal code.

## Installation
Open and run with Visual Studio Code (or your Python IDE of choice), make sure to 'pip install kivy' in your python environment before running.

## Status
This project is unfinished, but the UI is mostly complete.
